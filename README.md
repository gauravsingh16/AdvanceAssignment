## 1. Factorials
### implemented By *Aman Kumar Rawat*:
In this module we take input from user as a number 'N' and print the factorials of each number from 1 to N
The expected output of this module is as follows:

```
Enter a number: 10
1! = 1
2! = 2
3! = 6
4! = 24
5! = 120
6! = 720
7! = 5040
8! = 40320
9! = 362880
10! = 3628800
```

## 2. Links
### Implemented by *Gaurav Singh*:

In this module we try to connect with a URL and check if the webpage is live or not. For this we use 'Urllib.Request` library. 
The expected output of this module is as follows:

```

Enter a URL: https://github.com/
Output: This link is live

```
## 3. Randomness
### implemented By *Nidhi C B*:
In this module we take input from user as a number 'N' and the result of throwing 'N' die  and the average of those numbers is printed.
The expected output of this module is as follows:

```
Enter a number of dice to throw: 7
Die 1: 2
Die 2: 3
Die 3: 2
Die 4: 2
Die 5: 3
Die 6: 5
Die 7: 2
Average: 2.7

```

## 4. Collatz
### implemented By *Shreyansh Singh*:

In this module, We start with any positive integer 'N'.  If 'N' is even, then the next number in the sequence is 10 N/2.  If 'N' is odd, then the next number is 3N+ 1.  The same rules are then applied to the newly produced number and so on until we reach the number1, when we stop.

```

Enter the Starting Number :12
12 
6
3
10
5
16
8
4
2
1
