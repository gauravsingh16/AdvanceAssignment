### implemented By *Aman Kumar Rawat*:
In this module we take input from user as a number 'N' and print the factorials of each number from 1 to N
The expected output of this module is as follows:

```
Enter a number: 10
1! = 1
2! = 2
3! = 6
4! = 24
5! = 120
6! = 720
7! = 5040
8! = 40320
9! = 362880
10! = 3628800
```
